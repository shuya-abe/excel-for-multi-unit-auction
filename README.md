# excel-for-multi-unit-auction

This repository provides an Excel program for conducting multi-unit auction experiments in experimental economics.

## Overview

This Excel program implements the Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanism and run the Greedy-Based Algorithm (GBA) for determining the allocation of some units of a commodity and the payments of bidders in multiple-unit auctions.

## Features

*   Compute an allocation of units and the payments of bidders using the VCG mechanism.
*   Compute an allocation of units and the payments of bidders using the Greedy-Based Algorithm (GBA).

## Usage

1.  Set the initial conditions for the number of bidders and the number of units within the VBA window.
2.  In the `man` sheet, enter valuations and bids for all bidders for all units.
3.  Open the `result` sheet and click on the `run VCG` or `run GBA` button.
4.  View the results.
